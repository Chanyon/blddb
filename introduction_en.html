            <h2 style="text-align:left">ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>
            <p>
              　　My name is <strong>Zixing Wang</strong> (2018WANZ50). I want to introduce my new website
              (<a href="https://blddb.net" target="blank">blddb.net</a>) in this
              article. This website includes thousands of algorithms including corner twist, edge flip, 3-style corner
              (all buffers), 3-style edge (all buffers). It supports simplified Chinese and English, and is compatible
              with mobile phones, PCs and tablets. The website provides many options for each case, so the readers can
              select algorithm based on their own preference.
            </p>
            <img src="images/index_en.png" alt="" style="width:min(70%, 400px)" />
            <h2 style="text-align:left">WHAT IS NIGHTMARE SYSTEM?</h2>
            <p>
              　　<strong>Yifan Wang</strong> (2017WANY29) proposed the nightmare system in early 2020. In the nightmare
              system, there are no L layer moves. Left hand is always in home grip position and most of the operations
              are done by right hand. The average move count may be longer than the traditional 3-style because there
              are no lefty-style algorithms. However, the time in swapping between lefty-grip to righty-grip is reduced,
              which leads to great potential of speeding up your solve.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align:left">MODULES</h2>
            <p>
              　　Currently, there are seven modules in this website, 3-style corner, corner twist, 3-style edge, edge
              flip, 3BLD parity, lettering scheme and readme.</p>
            <p><strong>3-style corner, corner twist and 3BLD parity</strong></p>
            <p>
              　　All the algorithms provided go inline with the nightmare system and are generated by the program. The
              author ranks the algorithms by defining "equivalent moves". There are 55 different parameters in
              calculating
              equivalent moves. For example, an algorithm has a higher number of equivalent moves if D and D' are not
              alternate. Move D2 also increases equivalent moves (that’s why [D2, R U R'] ranks 7). The author mainly
              uses the nightmare algorithm set as training data, and adjusts the weight parameters through the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing" target="blank">simulated annealing
                algorithm</a>, so that the algorithm used in the latest nightmare algorithm set is ranked as high as
              possible among all the alternative algorithms. 18 algorithms with the highest ranking are displayed on the
              website and the one in gray is the main algorithm in the latest nightmare algorithm set.
            </p>
            <p>
              　　Enter the letter pair (buffer included) or the position to query. There will be at most 18 algorithms
              provided. It also provides a commutator form and recommendation position of gripping the cube.
            </p>
            <img src="images/corner_en.png" alt="" style="width:min(70%, 400px)" />
            <p><strong>3-style edge and edge flip</strong></p>
            <p>
              　　Most of the algorithms are traditional ones (including some symmetrical cases or swapping U, U' moves
              simply). It is temporarily impossible to brute-force all the positive solutions under the similar
              restrictions. Thus, the ranking is based on the number of moves (STM). At most 18 algorithms with the
              highest ranking are displayed on the website and the one in gray is the main algorithm in the latest
              nightmare algorithm set. For each specific 3-edge-cycle, users can enter the starting move sequence to
              filter the algorithm.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Lettering scheme</strong></p>
            <p>
              　　The Chinese lettering scheme and yellow(top)-red(front) is set as default. Speffz lettering scheme is
              also added. For users with a different coding system, they can modify the letter in the cube manually.
              Users can also change the orientation into their preferred one.
